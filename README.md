# 🔍 AI Pokédex — Just Point and Know Your Pokémon

Hey there!

I'm building a real-life Pokédex — just like the one in the anime.  
Yes, you heard that right. You'll be able to **point your camera at a Pokémon** (or its image/drawing), and it will instantly tell you what it is.

### 🧠 What’s Under the Hood?

We’ll be building:

- 🏗️ **AlexNet** from scratch — one of the OG deep learning models.
- 🐉 A classifier trained on **1,000+ Pokémon** across all generations.
- 💾 A massive dataset, ImageNet-style — sprites, art, and fan art included.

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

- `PyTorch` for model training
- `Torchvision` for preprocessing and augmentation
- `Gradio` or `Streamlit` for a fun interactive web app
- Maybe even a mobile version (👀)

### 🚧 Challenges

> ❌ I don’t have a top-tier GPU (just a 4050 laptop GPU),  
> ✅ So... we’ll have to **hack our way through** with:
>
> - Data-efficient tricks
> - Transfer learning
> - Mixed precision
> - And good ol’ patience

### 🤯 The Real Problem...

> **"How TF do I find Pokémon in the real world?"**

That’s the _true_ mystery.  
Until then, we’ll stick to images, screenshots, and drawings 😄

### 🌟 Stay tuned!

Whether you're a deep learning nerd or a lifelong Pokémon fan, you're in for a fun ride.

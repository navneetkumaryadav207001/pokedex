# üîç AI Pok√©dex ‚Äî Just Point and Know Your Pok√©mon

Hey there!

I'm building a real-life Pok√©dex ‚Äî just like the one in the anime.  
Yes, you heard that right. You'll be able to **point your camera at a Pok√©mon** (or its image/drawing), and it will instantly tell you what it is.

### üß† What‚Äôs Under the Hood?

We‚Äôll be building:

- It will be a react application
- üèóÔ∏è **AlexNet** from scratch ‚Äî one of the OG deep learning models.
- üêâ A classifier trained on **1,000+ Pok√©mon** across all generations.
- üíæ A massive dataset, ImageNet-style ‚Äî sprites, art, and fan art included.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- `PyTorch` for model training
- `Torchvision` for preprocessing and augmentation
- `Gradio` or `Streamlit` for a fun interactive web app
- Maybe even a mobile version (üëÄ)

### üöß Challenges

> ‚ùå I don‚Äôt have a top-tier GPU (just a 4050 laptop GPU),  
> ‚úÖ So... we‚Äôll have to **hack our way through** with:
>
> - Data-efficient tricks
> - Transfer learning
> - Mixed precision
> - And good ol‚Äô patience
